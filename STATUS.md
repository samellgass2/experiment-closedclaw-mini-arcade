# STATUS

## Project
- Name: `experiment-mini-arcade`
- Workflow: `Implement Flappy Bird-like Game`
- Snapshot Date (UTC): `2026-03-06`

## Current Development State
The Flappy Bird-like game is in a **playable MVP** state with core loop, rendering, controls, and persistence implemented.

Current player flow:
1. Game initializes in `LOADING`.
2. Local graphics are preloaded.
3. Game transitions to `READY` and waits for input.
4. Player starts run and plays in `RUNNING`.
5. Player can pause/resume via `PAUSED`.
6. Collision transitions game to `OVER` with restart path.

## What Is Implemented
- Core game loop using `requestAnimationFrame`.
- Bird physics:
  - Gravity-based vertical motion.
  - Flap impulse velocity.
  - Rotation tied to velocity.
  - Buffered flap input and flap cooldown handling.
- Obstacle system:
  - Timed pipe-pair spawning.
  - Horizontal pipe movement and cleanup.
  - Randomized top pipe height within bounds.
  - Score increment when passing pipe center.
- Collision detection:
  - Ceiling and floor collision.
  - Pipe collision with configurable hitbox padding.
- Rendering:
  - Sprite-based background, clouds, ground, pipes, and bird.
  - Fallback drawing paths if image assets are unavailable.
  - Ground scrolling and cloud drift animation.
- UI/HUD:
  - Live score and best score.
  - State label updates (`Loading`, `Ready`, `Running`, `Paused`, `Game Over`).
  - Overlay messaging for start/pause/game-over/asset-error.
- Input and controls:
  - `Space`: flap/start.
  - Pointer/click/tap: flap/start.
  - `P`: pause/resume.
  - `R`: restart to ready state.
- Persistence:
  - Best score saved and restored via `localStorage`.
- Asset loading:
  - Async preload with error collection.
  - Graceful "Asset Load Error" state on failures.

## Challenges / Risks Identified
- No automated gameplay test suite currently exists.
  - Regression risk remains high for physics tuning and collision changes.
- Asset loading can fail if files are missing or paths change.
  - Error UX exists, but there is no retry logic beyond manual restart.
- Physics and obstacle constants are static.
  - Difficulty does not scale over time and may feel uneven across players.
- Canvas-only rendering path limits accessibility.
  - Core game events are visual-first; screen-reader experience is minimal.
- No explicit touch-gesture conflict handling for some mobile browsers.
  - Pointer input works, but edge-case behavior may vary by device/browser.

## Suggested Next Steps
1. Add a lightweight automated validation layer (state transitions, scoring, collisions).
2. Add configurable difficulty ramp (speed/gap/spawn timing progression).
3. Add restart/retry affordances for asset-load failure path.
4. Add basic telemetry/debug overlay for tuning physics and spawn parameters.
5. Expand accessibility messaging beyond HUD text updates.

## Verification Notes
- No `package.json`, `Makefile`, or Python test config detected in repository.
- Manual code inspection confirms all major game systems above are present in:
  - `js/game.js`
  - `index.html`
  - `css/styles.css`
  - `assets/images/*.svg`
